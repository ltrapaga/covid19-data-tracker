## Description

Covid-19 Data Tracker is a web application that helps the public stay up-to-date on pertinent COVID-19 information in the United States. Search for any U.S. state via its acronym, and current data on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and positive versus negative tests will be displayed for that U.S. state. Want to compare the COVID-19 stats for multiple states? No problem! Simply search for any additional states and the info for each one will be added to the data tables alongside any previosuly searched states' data.
