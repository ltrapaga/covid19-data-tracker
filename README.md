# Project 1: COVID-19 Data Tracker

## Description

- My motivation when completing this project was to practice and become more proficient in the concepts I have learned in Module 5: Third Party APIs of Bootcamp.
- I built this project to apply what I have learned in class about JavaScript, jQuery, Day.js, Google Fonts API, etc., to a real web application. Creating my own Work Day Scheduler from the starter-code allowed me to advance my skills and enlightened me to the areas that I need to improve upon.
- During the completion of this project, I learned how to properly use Day.js to retrieve the current date and time, use jQuery to decrease the length and increase the efficiency of my JS code, and more. These capabilities helped me to dynamically increase the functionality of my web application through JavaScript.
